This is a beginner web dev project about creating a basic weather website from scratch using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The code fetches the weather API and sisplays it on the square
in between the page. The Source and About us tabs in the left navbar respectively take me to OpenWeather and My github respectively. And the background image rotates similarly with 
the weather displayed. Have a nice day.
